            <div class = "middle">For the Co-Ed Spring-Summer 2024 Collection, Maison Margiela stages a search for individual truth reflected in the generational adaptation of an inherited wardrobe. Evoking the memory of one age through the radical eye of the next, garments appear as if passed down from one generation to another, its their genetics modified and advanced. In a flashback narrative of the Maison's ongoing chronicle of the protagonists Count and Hen, the collection imagines its characters taking voyage with travelling trunks full of clothes which will ultimately end up in the adaptive hands of their future descendants. The spirit of adaptation infuses misfit silhouettes, spontaneously customised with tape or work-in-progress stitching. The Maisonâ€™s iconic Tabi is interpreted in new forms.</div>
