        You were my first experience with grief, or what I think is grief. I'm still unsure. <br />
        Is it normal to cry about someone's passing 2 years after it happened? That's odd, <br />
        right? I don't know if this website is for me. But, I do remember feeling incredibly <br />
        bitter at the world. At everyone who contributed to another spike in co-vid cases  <br />
        through thoughtless actions. I thought, maybe, if everyone were responsible to a   <br />
        degree, I could have visited you a lot sooner. A lot sooner. <br /><br />
        I didn't know what to say to you when I finally visited. Or if you could understand  <br />
        me in a tongue foreign to you, but too familiar to me. I wish I knew more to say to  <br /> 
        you and I wish I said it much, much sooner. There were plastic flowers. There were <br /> 
        grievers. There were cries, but not from us. The fan was loud. <br /> <br /> 

        
        I wonder a lot about you. If you passed peacefully. If you had any regrets. If you <br /> 
        wished to see anyone one more time, if you knew. If I could have been one of them. <br /> 
        The letters you wrote, what you thought at night. I think wonder a lot, but I found <br /> 
        that I don't have an awful lot to say. Is that terrible? <br />
