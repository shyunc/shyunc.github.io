                For the Co-Ed Spring-Summer 2024 Collection, Maison Margiela stages a search for individual truth reflected 
                in the generational adaptation of an inherited wardrobe. Evoking the memory of one age through the radical eye of the next, 
                garments appear as if passed down from one generation to another, its their genetics modified and advanced. In a flashback 
                narrative of the Maison's ongoing chronicle of the protagonists Count and Hen, the collection imagines its characters taking 
                voyage with travelling trunks full of clothes which will ultimately end up in the adaptive hands of their future descendants. 
                The spirit of adaptation infuses misfit silhouettes, spontaneously customised with tape or work-in-progress stitching. The 
                Maison’s iconic Tabi is interpreted in new and exciting forms.

                The label was founded in 1988 and carved a name for its rejection of traditional fashion. This was continued as part of the Galliano-led SS24, as models morphed and contorted their bodies into slouched positions as part of a dramatic demonstration of avant-garde deconstruction.

                The collection was positioned at the intersection of men’s and womenswear. Between playful takes on traditionally masculine tailoring, we saw a deviation in the form of traditional womenswear looks, which were modelled at a slower pace. A grey dress was cut close to its wearer, featuring lace sleeves and detailing to the bust and extending from the hip. The display was soundtracked by “Masculinity” by Lucky Love, asking the audience the following questions: “Do I walk like a boy? / Do I speak like a boy? / Do I kiss like a boy? / Do I spit like a boy?”

                Throughout the display, there was a juxtaposition present in the varying movements of the models, with some walking quickly and exaggerated, with their heads down, mirroring the movement of a predator as it chased slower-moving looks.

                Since its inception, which was when Martin Margiela was at the helm, the Parisian label has brought unconventional materials to the runway, and this was seen in its SS24 collection. It showed layered PVC materials meeting with pale pink corset tops, giving a half-wet appearance with the weathered look continued in cracked paint Tabis. Further deconstruction was seen across a similar outfit, which presented shiny tassel detailing, with a printed top worn off-the-shoulder and a large handbag carried loosely by the model’s side.
                Galliano’s display of deconstruction ended with a sleek black dress, which featured a rounded neckline and signature removable white stitching. Elegantly falling below the knee, it was paired with black tights and grey Tabi heels complete with black lace detailing, rounding out the linear display in the same anthologised structure as it began.
